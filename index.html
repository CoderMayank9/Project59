        Initially popular as the “Gentleman’s Game,” cricket, over the years has emerged as a sport beyond the borders of gender, race and countries. Every time we hear words like “How was that?” or “Bowled out,” we can only think of the heartbeats, the cheering, the pressure and the amazement of a cricket match.

        The International Cricket Council (ICC) governs matches globally whereas the rules of the game are laid down in a code called Laws of Cricket. Every cricket match is played between two teams of 15 players out of which the best and fittest 11 play the match. The match equipment including bat’s weight, usage of the ball, wicket dimensions, position of umpires, etc. are strictly monitored on the field.The format has changed considerably with matches in both limited and unlimited overs. In addition to large scale tournaments like the World Cup, country-based premier leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), Big Bash League (BBL) and Champions League (CLT20) have gained popularity. The major national team rivalries in cricket are seen between England and Australia, India and Pakistan, South Africa and England with nail-biting matches.

        Although cricket is not the national game of India, it is definitely the most followed and played. The Men’s national team has won the cricket world cup in all formats under the leadership of captains like Kapil Dev and M.S. Dhoni. The Women’s national team is prospering and has reached world cup finals with players like Mithali Raj, Smriti Mandhana, Jhulan Goswami and so on. Even the under 19 and blind cricket teams of India have brought home several trophies.
